How to structure the app.
- Create Account
  - Name of Account
  - Starting Month/Year
  - Starting Balance
  - How to parse the records?
    - Scotiabank
      - chequing
      - savings
      - visa
  - Completing this will give the Account an ID.
- The data store can be an array of accounts
  - Each account will have records for months/years underneath it.
  - When you load a month/year you ask all accounts, do you have records for this month, or was the account started by this month then 
    don't even show the account.


Instead of uploading files on a monthly basis,
allow the user to upload a file that contains records
and update them based on date. That way if a user uploads
a file that contains half of may and half of june, they
don't need to separate out the records. Records uploaded
a 2nd time that match, date, description, credit, debit
will flagged as duplicates.
- How does the data structure look then?
-- accounts (base account info)
-- records (object with key of account id)
  -- contains all records?
    -- would this mean getting december of 2017 would require parsing?
