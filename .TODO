TODO

- When editing a record have the option to apply the description / category change to 
  - all records
  - all records in the future
  - single instance
  - This will create a background record (possibly invisible) that will be associated with all
    future records of that description, and will be given the same category.
- Improve importing to flag duplicate records on the account.
- Improve editing of accounts that have records imported already
- Allow for archiving accounts
- Home Page graphs covering multiple accounts
- Sorting order accounts by user input? (https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc perhaps?)
- Error Boundary HOC?
  - Right now if one of the account views breaks, you can't visit another account until you
    visit another route first. Being able to wrap all components in a error boundary HOC would
    be cool!
