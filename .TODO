How to structure the app.
- Create Account
  - Name of Account
  - Starting Month/Year
  - Starting Balance
  - How to parse the records?
    - Scotiabank
      - chequing
      - savings
      - visa
  - Completing this will give the Account an ID.
- The data store can be an array of accounts
  - Each account will have records for months/years underneath it.
  - When you load a month/year you ask all accounts, do you have records for this month, or was the account started by this month then 
    don't even show the account.

// Sample for calculating balance.
account.newBalance = account.startingBalance
  - records.map(r => r.debit || 0).reduce((a, b) => a + b)
  + records.map(r => r.credit || 0).reduce((a, b) => a + b);

Instead of uploading files on a monthly basis,
allow the user to upload a file that contains records
and update them based on date. That way if a user uploads
a file that contains half of may and half of june, they
don't need to separate out the records. Records uploaded
a 2nd time that match, date, description, credit, debit
will flagged as duplicates.
- How does the data structure look then?
-- accounts (base account info)
-- records (object with key of account id)
  -- contains all records?
    -- would this mean getting december of 2017 would require parsing?
